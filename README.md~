# 21-s-Arcade
A 2 in 1 game in python, using pygame.


## In-short

**21's Arcade** is a 2-in-1 PC game, written in python using pygame library. The 2 games it offers are : **Snake** and **Space Trek**.

The complete learning and development procedure took 21 hours, hence the name. Also, coincidentally, the date of project completion, class roll number of the developer (that's me), and the century it was developed in; all equal 21.

## Tools Used

python
pygame
py2exe
photoshop

## Date of completion
21 April 2014. (Day Before the techFest-TechnoGyan)

## Developer
Manan Singh


## Details

It is a 2-in-1 game, consisting of 2 games :
        1. Snake
        2. Space Trek
Both the games and the interfaces are developed completely in python using pygame. 

The graphics are designed using Adobe Photoshop, and sounds are taken from freesound.org.

The complete learning and development procedure [ "learning while doing" ] from scratch took 21 hours, hence the name 21's arcade. Also, the date of project completion was 21 April 2014; the roll number of developer (that's me) was 21; and the game was an attempt to present virtually a 21st Century's Arcade.

It can be used as a supplement to a crash course program - '21 hours : Code & Play' aimed at teaching the game development using python and pygame in 21 hours.


*Disclaimer*: the games do have few bugs, as the games' main objective was Game Development education in 21 hours.

This was a first game project in python and pygame. Much better and cooler games are on the way of release soon (hopefully).
